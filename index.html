	<p class = "radie">Thermodynamics 
<p class = "rad">
First of all, in order to understand the basis of our project we have to talk about Thermodynamics.  Thermodynamics is the process that affects the freezing  and the melting of sea ice. For example, when the temperature of the ocean reaches the freezing point for salt water (which would be -1.8 degrees Celsius and 28.8 degrees for Fahrenheit), the ice begins to grow and when the temperature rises above the freezing point, the ice begins to melt. The amount and the rates for the growth and melting of the ice depend on how the heat is exchanged within the sea ice itself and between the top and bottom of the ice. Since we're tracking the growth and melting of sea ice, we are essentially tracking the thermodynamics of the sea ice.
<p class = "radie">
Albedo and Positive Feedback Loop
<p class = "rad">
When the ocean surface reaches freezing point, ice starts to form. As the months get colder, and less sunlight reaches the Arctic, additional sea ice forms, generally reaching its maximum in early March. Then once the temperature rises, and more sunlight reaches the Arctic, the sea ice begins to melt, typically reaching its minimum in early September. Thus the cycle continues of sea ice growing and melting, with the maximums and minimums occurring towards the end of the winter and summer seasons because the ocean lags behind the atmosphere in warming and cooling. As ice begins to grow, it starts to act as an insulator between the ocean and atmosphere. Albedo is the indicator of how well a surface reflects solar energy, and varies between 0 and 1, 0 meaning that the surface absorbs all of the incoming energy, while a surface with a value of 1 reflects that energy. Sea ice has higher albedo because of its grey-white surface, with a value of 0.5-0.7 on the albedo scale, compared to the ocean, which has an albedo of about 0.06. Sea ice with snow has an even higher albedo value, reflecting nearly 90% of solar energy. The larger the sea ice extent is, the more energy from sunlight gets reflected, which keeps the ocean and atmosphere cool.  The thickness of the ice is another contributing factor in the regulation of water temperatures. The ice, known as multiyear ice, that survives the summer melt becomes thicker and stronger, making it much more effective at keeping the water and atmosphere cool. While, first year ice, ice that did not survive the summer melt, is much thinner and more susceptible to storms and heat. Each year as temperatures rise, there is less and less multiyear ice, and as a result the Arctic sea ice becomes less effective at keeping solar energy out. As the snow starts to melt, melt ponds form, which causes the albedo to drop, and more solar radiation is absorbed, which increases the rate of melting. As more sea ice begins to melt, the dark surface of the ocean becomes larger, and absorbs a significantly larger amount of sunlight, which then causes the sea surface and overlaying temperature to rise, which then leads to more ice melting, creating a vicious cycle known as the positive feedback loop or Arctic Amplification.  </p>

	Our Project

		<p class = "rad">Our idea for the mathematical side of the project was to use code to create an equation that could analyze the data set, and to graph it along with coding our own website so that we could create everything by ourselves. Coding the data also included the added benefit of being able to use the graphs that we were also able to code in order to help show what the data looked like and meant.</p>

<h4 class = "sea">Procedure Used</h4>

		<p class = "rad">To find each of the models we used curve fitting on python. After plotting each of the data points, we fitted the function to multiple polynomial models with different degrees. Then we picked the model with the highest R2 value. When finding the maximums and minimums of the sea ice extent we set the derivatives equal to zero and solved.  Then for finding the month with the fastest melting rate we used the same process, except instead of using the first derivative, we used the second derivative.  </p>

<h4 class = "seasea">Discussion and Analysis</h4>
	<p class = "read"> 2.Use your models to find the maximum and minimum sea ice extent. Summarize your results in a few sentences for each model and compare any similarities and/or difference between the two years (max, min, month of max/min, time between max/min, etc.)</p>

<p class = "reader">
Max & Mins: 
<p class = "reader">
In 1980 the sea ice extent reached its maximum approximately halfway between February and March. This makes it approximately 2.549 months into the year, and at this time the sea ice extent was around 16.09028 million square kilometers. 1980 then has a minimum at around the end of the eight month, when x ≅ 8.873 months the sea ice extent was around 7.4507 million square kilometers. 
<p class = "reader">
In 2012 the sea ice extent reached its maximum of around 15.004 million square kilometers at the beginning of the third month, when x ≅ 3.055 months. The minimum then occurred at 8.849 months, where the sea ice extent was approximately 3.885 million square kilometers. 
<p class = "reader">
In 2019 the maximum was at around 2.072 months, where the sea ice extent reached 14.5544 million square kilometers. Then the minimum occurred during the end of the eight month, when x ≅ 8.889 months and the sea ice extent was about 4.4345 million square kilometers. 
<p class = "reader">
The maximums and minimums generally happen at around the same time each year. The sea ice extent reaches its maximum sometime around February and March, and the minimum is usually during the month of August.

	<p class = "read">3.Use your models to find the month of fastest melting of sea ice. Summarize your results in a few sentences for each model, including how fast the ice was melting at these points, and compare any similarities and difference between the two years. You summary should address the question: Is the speed of ice melting meaningfully different between any of the three years (Hint: Units are important here.)?</p>
<p class = "reader">
Months of Fastest Melting of Sea Ice:
<p class = "reader">
Is the speed of ice melting meaningfully
different between any of the three years (Hint: Units are important here.)?
<p class = "reader">
In 1980 the month of fastest melting of sea ice was around the beginning/middle of the 6th month (x=6.4203), where the ice was melting at a rate of 2.223 million square kilometers. 
<p class = "reader">
In 2012, the middle of the 6th month (x=6.6388) had the fastest rate of melting ice, at a rate of 3.238 million square kilometers.
<p class = "reader">
In 2019 the month with the fastest melting rate was towards the end of the 6th month (x=6.7956), with a rate of 2.716 million square kilometers. 
<p class = "reader">
The month with the fastest melting of sea ice over the three years that are recorded ends up being the 6th month (aka June). In each of these years the extent of the sea ice decreases about one to two million square kilometers per month but in the 6th month of each year the extent of the sea ice ends up decreasing three million square kilometers. This shows that during this month the sea ice is melting faster over the course of the month since over the same amount of time the ice is melting more and therefore faster. The contrast between the 3 years is that in 2012 this heightened speed of melting ice extends into the 7th month as well which sees the same drop of 3 million square kilometers of sea ice. The fact that this takes place during June, which is when tempatures are rising and summer is starting is clearly connected and not at all suprising. What is surprising is the difference in the speed at which the ice melts at this point in the year is pretty consistent between all of the years that we used which is not what I would've predicted. The only difference seems to be how much ice is actually there rather than the rate at which it is melting, with the ice being at about 10 million square kilometers for both 2012 and 2019 while it is approximately 12 million square kilometers for 1980.   

	<p class = "read">4. Explain how the analysis here along with global warming provides an example of this positive feedback look.</p>
<p class = "reader">
	The ice reflects the energy from the sunlight (because the ice is white and has a higher albedo), but after it has melted there isn’t as much to reflect the light. There's more ocean surface and less ice, and since the ocean surface is dark it absorbs the heat. This absorption causes the surface temperature to rise, and this causes more and more ice to melt which makes it a large cycle of more ice melting. This positive feedback loop is reflected in the change between the 1980, 2012, and 2019 data where there is more ice overall, and  the amount of sea ice decreases even if the rate at which the ice is melting is staying the same. Over the years more of the ice is melting and less is being frozen again once the months become colder, which can be seen in the initial graph of the data where 1980 clearly has more sea ice extent overall, even though it roughly follows the same path of melting. The 2012 and 2019 graphs also have more extreme contrasts between their maximum and minimums.

<h4 class = "seasea">Conclusion and Future Ideas</h4>
	<p class = "radar">What do we know?
<p class = "reader">
While all of the graphs follow the same rough path of the extent of sea ice increasing and decreasing, even sharing the same month of fastest melting sea ice, by looking at our data sets one of the first things you can notice is the difference in the extent between the data of 1980 and the data of 2012 and 2019. The extent in 1980 is overall greater, the graph being shifted up so you can see it follows the same path just with more ice overall for the year. Additionally, in the 2010s there is a greater contrast between the minimum and maximums where the ice melts more than in 1980 which means that in the colder months it also ends up freezing more while in 1980 there is less ice being melted and therefore less ice being refrozen than the other years.
<p class = "reader">
So why do we need to do something about the shrinking sea ice extent? 
<p class = "reader">
Focusing solely on the Arctic, with the way that things are going, there is a possibility for more ship routes through the Arctic, opportunities for oil drilling, tourism spots, and overall a larger human footprint. This might seem good in some ways but with it comes discord over who has control over these ship routes and oil opportunities. It would also have a major impact on the wildlife who would be either losing their habitat or being put in danger by humans. 
<p class = "reader">
So what can we do?
<p class = "reader">
Moving away from using fossil fuels is one of the obvious first steps and moving towards more sustainable power sources such as solar, wind, and water. Another potential step towards a more sustainable future is decarbonizing buildings. The city of Ithaca, NY, elected to decarbonize and electrify its buildings. This would entail examining the appliances used in a building to reduce the exhaustion of fossil fuels. In the United States, nearly 40% of greenhouse gas emissions are from buildings. Ithaca’s project is expected to save around 160,000 tons of carbon dioxide.
<p class = "reader">
Unfortunately the reality is that most large corporations and governments will be hesitant to fully or even partially move towards more green friendly solutions as most of them would not want to spend the money to make this change, or the effort. The reality is that there are deep rooted ways of doing things that have companies built on them, companies that might not exist if we were to change our ways. Since these companies make tons of money, those who profit off of them will never want to get rid of their source of income. It would take even more drastic events in order to get people to see the light of day and make a change for the better.
